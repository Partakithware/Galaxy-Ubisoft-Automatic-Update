# Galaxy-Ubisoft-Automatic-Update
Update to the gog-galaxy ubisoft integration that allows the AppID and GenomeID to fetch upto date information each start.

Just added a zip release, if you would like to be part of tracked downloads get the update from there.

Installation:
 Open the Uplay plugin directory (installed via gog galaxy settings)
 
 It can be found at "%LOCALAPPDATA%\GOG.com\Galaxy\plugins\installed\uplay_afb5a69c-b2ee-4d58-b916-f4cd75d4999a\"

 Download the plugin.py and update_consts.py from here.

 Replace the plugin.py with this Versions and make sure to copy update_consts.py into the same folder. (The uplay one I had you open)

 Retry connection. (May have to restart GOG Galaxy)


Done!

 When ubisoft updates ID's you should be fine from now on.
 
 Fix-method I used: Sloppy requiring minimal changes by using a physical update (not best practice)

 Big thanks to "ShadixAced" on GOG as they provided the link for getting the updated ID's via the API.
